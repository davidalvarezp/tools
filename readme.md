# Local-First Tools

A collection of privacy-friendly web tools that run entirely in your browser.

**No uploads. No tracking. No server-side processing.**

All tools are built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and are designed to work offline once loaded.

## ✨ Why local-first?

Most “online tools” upload your files to a server.
These tools don’t.

- Your files never leave your device
- Everything runs client-side
- Works offline after the first load
- No accounts, no cookies, no analytics

## 🛠️ Tools

- **Remove Image Metadata**  
  Strip EXIF metadata from images locally in your browser.
