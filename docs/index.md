# Local-First Tools

A collection of **privacy-friendly web tools** that run entirely in your browser.

**No uploads. No tracking. No server-side processing.**

## Why local-first?

Most “online tools” upload your files to a server.  
These tools don’t.

- Your data never leaves your device
- Everything runs client-side
- Works offline after the first load
- No accounts, no cookies, no analytics
